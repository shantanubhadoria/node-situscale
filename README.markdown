## Description
This package allows you to set up asynchronous notifications for weight update notifications from SITU scale.

## Install

You can install this package with `npm`.

### npm

```shell
npm install situscale
```

## Synopsis
```javascript
var SituScale = require('situscale');

var scaleInstance = new SituScale(address);
```

## Discovering Situscales in your vicinity
You can discover situscales in your vicinity using this module if you do not have the address for your situscale.

```javascript
// discover.js
var SituScale = require('situscale');

var scale = new SituScale();
scale.searchScales(function(scale) {
  // Callback run for every new scale discovered in the vicinity till stopSearching is called()
  console.log("Discovered SITU scale with address: " + scale.address);
});

// Stop Searching after 3 seconds
setTimeout(
  scale.stopSearching(),
  3000
);
```

## Receiving weight notifications from a specific SITU scale
Once you know the address for your SITU scale you can receive weight notifications from it as and when they happen.
Note that the weight is always received in grams and you must convert it to other unit of calculation if you need to.

```javascript
var SituScale = require('situscale');

var address = "c6:e3:c7:5e:fd:fc";
var scaleInstance = new SituScale(address);

scale.getWeight(function(weight){
  console.log(weight);
});
```

## Receiving weight notifications from all the SITU scales in your vicinity (Avaliable since v1.0.4)
If you wish to receive notifications from all available SITU scales in your vicinity without knowing the address of the
SITU scales, then you may use the getAllWeights function.

```javascript
// readAll.js
var SituScale = require('situscale');

var scale = new SituScale();

scale.getAllWeights(function(weight, scale) {
  console.log("Scale with address: " + scale.address + ' notified weight of ' + weight + ' gms.');
});

```

## Turning weight notifications on or off after connecting.
You can turn off weight notifications and turn them on as needed intermittently to save scale battery. The scale will
still be connected on bluetooth but it will not send notifications while the notifications are turned off this way.

```javascript
var SituScale = require('situscale');

var address = "c6:e3:c7:5e:fd:fc";
var scaleInstance = new SituScale(address);

scale.getWeight(function(weight){ // This function is called each time a weight notification is received.
  console.log(weight);
});

// Stop weight notifications after 3 seconds
setTimeout(function(){
  scale.stopNotifications();
  console.log('stopped notifications');

  // Start weight notifications after another 3 seconds
  setTimeout(function(){
    scale.startNotifications();
    console.log('started notifications');
  });
});
```

## Disconnecting from the scale
You can disconnect from the SITU scale when you are done using it. Note that in disconnected state the scale will
automatically power down after some time at the moment.

```javascript
var SituScale = require('situscale');

var address = "c6:e3:c7:5e:fd:fc";
var scaleInstance = new SituScale(address);

scale.getWeight(function(weight){ // This function is called each time a weight notification is received.
  console.log(weight);
});

// Stop weight notifications after 3 seconds
setTimeout(function(){
  scale.stopNotifications();
  console.log('stopped notifications');
  setTimeout(function(){
    scale.disconnect();
    console.log('disconnected');
  }, 3000);
});
```
